GHIPS - GitHub Issue and Pull Request Summary

I wanted an easy way to see how many Issues and PR's had been submitted by the public and by members of an org over different intervals. This tool does what I needed and is fairly generic. To adapt and use, set an environment variable for your GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN and your GHIPS_ORG (the org you want to report on). This only looks at public repos.
